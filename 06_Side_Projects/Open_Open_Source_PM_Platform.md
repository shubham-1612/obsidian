# Open★Open‑Source PM Platform

Idea: blockchain‑anchored OSS PM w/ AI triage, contributor reward tokens.

### Market Research
- No close FOSS alternative; Gitcoin closest analogue (bounty‑based).
- Feasibility: moderate — depends on blockchain cost & contributor UX.

### Next
- Draft whitepaper (tokenomics, governance).  
- MVP: GitHub app that labels issues, tracks PR scoring.
