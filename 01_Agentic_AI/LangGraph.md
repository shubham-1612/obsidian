# LangGraph

Declarative graph framework used as the spine for your agent orchestration.

## Highlights From Chats
- *Checkpoints* & *breakpoints* enable state rewind + live user steering.
- Cursor editor integration: write nodes/edges via prompt → code gen.
- Moving from in‑memory runner → persistent DB runner (PostgreSQL) to allow long‑running workflows.

## Open Threads
- Extend graph runner to emit **trace events** for meta‑reasoner.
- Explore **dynamic edge injection** so agents can restructure graph mid‑run.
